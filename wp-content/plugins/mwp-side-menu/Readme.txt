Create a Floating menu - add convenience and informativeness to your site!

== Description ==

WordPress Plugin "Wow Side Menu" was created to highlight the site compared to other resources that are using a similar design template. By installing the plugin, you also enhance ease of use and the informative content of each page of the web-resource.

The plugin is compatible with another product developed by our company – [Modal Windows](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mwp-modal-windows/). Their concurrent use will render dialog and modal windows in the side panels of the site and thereby make the design more concise and user-friendly.

Use Floating menu for WordPress plugin with [Modal Windows](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mwp-modal-windows/) for demonstration of all types of notifications. Assign a sidebar as a navigation element of the site using the anchor links. .

After adding the plugins [Modal Windows](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mwp-modal-windows/) and [Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mwp-forms/) floating menu will become the basis for placing registration and authorization forms, collecting subscriber base for email newsletters.
